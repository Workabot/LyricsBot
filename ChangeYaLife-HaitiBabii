Suh, ah
Oh, oh

Money, power, and respect (respect)
Trick, I'm poppin', and I did it with a check (with a check)
Quit complaining, you a rookie, I'm a vet
DeMarcus Cousins, bitch, I always got a TEC
Remember Lil' Haiti slept with the chop next to the window
If they fonkin' with my niggas, then they fonkin' with me too
I got no time to spend it with bitches fucking with the crew
In the grass, they try to snake me, I'm fucking with voodoo
From the streets where young niggas just tryna get paid
Reminiscing the dead homies, sippin' on cognac

Mama seen me up on TV, and she know this won't stop
Know that Rollie on your wrist got you green, tick-tock
Thick bitch, juicy lips, with some Gucci flip-flops
Like if you and I could go out one night
I'll show you a good time
Promise you, I'll change your mind, just let me freak you
Keep this between me and you (let me freak your mind)

Don't go telling all your friends that we in love for real (girl, you love me, yes, you do)
Don't go telling all your friends that we in love for real
Baby, get this dick that change your life (tell me how you feel)

Save all that gossip for your mama
He say, she say drama
And I know how you feel
So I gotta keep it real
I can't stand being alone
So baby, tonight you gotta come through
I'ma slide in a two-seater right behind you
Baby, tell me how you feel, I'ma show you what I do
If this rap shit don't work, I'ma ride with the banger (banger)

You got my heart and that's dangerous
But I fell in love with the streets
And I fell asleep with the heat
Tell me, baby, don't lie to me (don't lie)
Was you really finna slide for me? (Was you really finna slide?)
Was you really finna ride for me? (Was you really finna ride?)
Is you really finna die for me? (Is you really finna die?)

Don't go telling all your friends that we in love for real (girl, you love me, yes, you do)
Don't go telling all your friends that we in love for real
Baby, get this dick that change your life (tell me how you feel)
